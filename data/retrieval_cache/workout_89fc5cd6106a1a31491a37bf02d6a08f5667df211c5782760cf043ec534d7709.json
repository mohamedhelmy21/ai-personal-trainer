"The use of machine exercises like Machine Fly and Cable Lat Pulldown can be beneficial for beginners as they often provide more stability and can be easier to learn proper form compared to free weight exercises.[1, 11] This allows beginners to focus on muscle activation and build confidence before progressing to more complex movements. The routine also incorporates dumbbell and cable exercises, providing a variety of stimuli for the upper body muscles. Details for the other three workout days (Upper Body 2, Lower Body 1, and Lower Body 2) are not provided in the available snippet.\n---\nThe alternating Workout A and B structure provides variation and ensures that all muscle groups are trained adequately throughout the week. The specific exercises in Workout B are not detailed in the provided snippet. The routine also incorporates a periodized approach over a 12-week duration, using different microcycles with varying Repetitions in Reserve (RIR), suggesting a structured progression for muscle growth.\n---\nworkout.8 Protein, in the range of 20 to 30 grams, especially for resistance training, can also be beneficial in the pre-workout period.8 However, it is generally advisable to limit the intake of fats before exercise due to their slower digestion rate, which could potentially lead to stomach upset during activity.8 The ACSM recommends consuming a meal or snack containing carbohydrates and fluids approximately 1 to 4 hours before exercise to allow for proper digestion and energy availability.5 Intra-workout nutrition focuses on maintaining blood glucose levels and providing a continuous supply of fuel to the working muscles during exercise.5 Nutrient intake during exercise is particularly beneficial for activities lasting longer than 60 to 90 minutes.2 During such prolonged exercise, it is recommended to consume carbohydrates at a rate of approximately 30 to 60 grams per hour, with the possibility of increasing this to up to 90 grams per hour for ultra-endurance events.5 Carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks can be particularly advantageous during both competition and training as they provide both energy and help maintain fluid balance.9 Alongside nutrient intake, hydration is also critical during exercise; athletes should aim to consume fluids every 10 to 20 minutes.10 In endurance events, where sweat losses can be significant, sodium replacement may also be necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.8 Post-workout nutrition is crucial for replenishing depleted glycogen stores and providing the necessary protein for muscle tissue repair and synthesis.5 It is recommended to consume carbohydrates, approximately 1.0 to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight or 60 to 120 grams in total, within 30 minutes after exercise to maximize glycogen replenishment.5 Simultaneously, consuming 20 to 30 grams of protein within the same 30-minute window is important for stimulating muscle protein synthesis.8 A carbohydrate-to-protein ratio of 3:1 to 4:1 is often suggested to optimize both glycogen recovery and muscle repair.8 It is important to continue refeeding with a balanced post-workout meal to meet ongoing refueling and recovery needs, with the specific nutrient amounts depending on the intensity and duration of the exercise session.8 Chocolate milk has been suggested as a beneficial post-workout beverage due to its combination of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.11 While less extensively researched, pre-sleep nutrition is an emerging area of interest in sports nutrition. The potential benefits include supporting muscle recovery by providing a sustained release of amino acids throughout the night. Casein protein, due to its slower digestion rate compared to other protein sources like whey, is often recommended as a pre-sleep protein source to provide a prolonged supply of amino acids to the muscles during the overnight fasting period. However, further research is still needed to fully elucidate the optimal strategies and benefits of pre-sleep nutrition for athletes."
