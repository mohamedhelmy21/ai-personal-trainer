"may find that full body workouts do not provide sufficient volume for specific muscle groups.143 8. Exercise Selection & Categorization Choosing the right exercises is critical for achieving specific fitness goals and ensuring a well-rounded training program. Exercises can be broadly categorized into compound and isolation movements.51 Priority compound lifts are multi-joint exercises that engage several muscle groups simultaneously, making them highly efficient for building overall strength and muscle mass.51 For the chest, priority compound lifts include the bench press, incline press, dips, and push-ups.146 For the back, pull-ups, rows (barbell, dumbbell, cable), and deadlifts are key.55 Legs are effectively trained with squats (back, front, goblet), deadlifts, lunges, and leg presses.146 The overhead press is a primary compound exercise for the shoulders.146 For the arms, close-grip bench presses and dips target the triceps, while rows and pull-ups heavily involve the biceps.146 Isolation exercises are single-joint movements that focus on a specific muscle group.51 They are useful for targeting individual muscles, addressing imbalances, and enhancing muscle definition.51 Examples include bicep curls for the biceps, tricep extensions for the triceps, lateral raises for the shoulders, leg extensions and hamstring curls for the legs, and chest flyes for the chest.19 Warm-up routines should consist of 5-10 minutes of light cardiovascular activity followed by dynamic stretching that mimics the movements of the workout.153 Muscle activation exercises can also be included to prime specific muscle groups.153 Cool-down routines should last 5-10 minutes and involve a gradual decrease in the intensity of the workout followed by static stretching, holding each stretch for 10-30 seconds to target the muscles used during the session.153 Core training frameworks should incorporate exercises that target stability and strength in all planes of motion.156 This includes anti-rotation exercises like the Pallof press and single-arm carries, anti-extension exercises such as the plank and dead bug, and dynamic core exercises like wood chops and Russian twists.158 McGill's Big Three (curl-up, side bridge, bird dog) are also foundational exercises for core stability.162 9. Mobility & Stretching Incorporating mobility and stretching routines is crucial for maintaining joint health, improving range of motion, preventing injuries, and enhancing recovery.96 For recovery days, static stretching routines that target major muscle groups such as hamstrings, shoulders, hips, and back are recommended. Holding each stretch for 30-60 seconds can help reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility.98 Yoga and foam rolling can also be valuable additions to a recovery routine.91 Warm-ups should prioritize dynamic stretching to prepare the body for exercise.165 Examples include leg swings, arm circles, torso twists, walking lunges, and high knees, which help to increase blood flow and improve joint mobility.166 Post-lifting cooldowns should include static stretching of the muscles that were worked during the session. Holding each stretch for 10-30 seconds can aid in muscle recovery and improve flexibility.98 Dynamic stretching involves active movements that take joints and muscles through a full range of motion, while static stretching involves holding a stretch in a stationary position.165 Dynamic stretching is generally better for warm-ups as it prepares the body for movement, whereas static stretching is more effective for improving flexibility and is typically done after exercise.96 Muscle group-specific stretching protocols are beneficial for targeting areas that tend to get tight. For hamstrings, exercises like lying hamstring stretches and Romanian deadlifts can be effective. For shoulders, arm circles and chest stretches are helpful. For hips, butterfly stretches and hip flexor stretches can improve mobility.166 10. Emerging & Alternative Models The field of exercise science is continuously evolving, with emerging and alternative training models offering unique approaches to fitness. Low-volume, high-intensity training (HIT) involves short, intense workouts, often with just one set per exercise performed close to failure.169 Research suggests that HIT can be an effective and time-efficient method for building strength and muscle, particularly for individuals with limited time.169 Minimalist training approaches, involving as little as 1-2 workouts per week, have also shown to be surprisingly effective for maintaining and even building strength and muscle, highlighting that lack of time need not be a barrier to training.169 Eccentric-overload training focuses on emphasizing the muscle-lengthening (eccentric) phase of an exercise, typically performed slowly over 3-10 seconds.65 This method can lead to increased muscle damage and promote hypertrophy. Recent research indicates that training close to failure (within 1-2 repetitions) can yield similar muscle growth and strength gains compared to consistently training to complete failure, potentially with less fatigue.169 These emerging and alternative models offer efficient and effective training strategies that can be particularly appealing to busy users or those seeking to optimize their workouts with novel techniques. 11. Scientific References & Guidelines This report has compiled information from various scientific sources and guidelines, including the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). These organizations are leading authorities in the field of exercise science and provide\n---\nprogressive overload is fundamental to achieving long-term fitness improvements, regardless of the specific goal.108 It involves gradually increasing the demands placed on the body over time, forcing it to adapt and become stronger or more enduring.110 This can be accomplished by incrementally increasing the weight lifted, the number of repetitions or sets, the training frequency, the intensity of the exercise, the time under tension, or the difficulty of the exercise.108 For beginners, progress often occurs rapidly, while intermediate and advanced lifters may require more nuanced strategies and smaller increments of progression.113 A general guideline is to increase training load by no more than 10% per week, always prioritizing proper form over lifting heavier weight.108 Training plateaus, where progress stalls despite consistent effort, are a common experience.115 They can be detected by a lack of improvement in strength, endurance, or muscle growth, a decrease in motivation, persistent fatigue, or a lack of visible changes in body composition.117 To overcome plateaus, it's essential to identify the underlying cause, which might include a lack of variety in the training program, insufficient training stimulus, inadequate recovery, or issues with nutrition and sleep.115 Strategies for adapting training after hitting a plateau include introducing new exercises, modifying training variables such as sets, reps, intensity, tempo, and rest periods, incorporating different training styles like HIIT or circuit training, reviewing and adjusting nutritional intake and recovery protocols, and considering the implementation of deload weeks.117 Intensity techniques can be strategically employed to push past plateaus and provide a novel stimulus for muscle growth and strength gains.121 These techniques include drop sets, where the weight is reduced during a set after reaching failure to continue with more repetitions; rest-pause training, involving short rest intervals within a set to allow for more repetitions at a given weight; tempo manipulation, varying the speed of the concentric and eccentric phases of a lift; supersets, performing two exercises back-to-back; and pyramid sets, where weight is progressively increased or decreased across sets with corresponding changes in repetitions.123 These techniques are generally more suitable for intermediate to advanced lifters.125 Volume cycling and periodization are essential for long-term progress, particularly for hypertrophy and strength goals.126 Periodization involves planned cycles of training variables (volume, intensity) to optimize adaptation and manage fatigue.128 Linear periodization involves a gradual increase in intensity and decrease in volume over time, while undulating periodization incorporates more frequent variations in these variables.129 Volume cycling involves strategically varying the total amount of work performed over different training blocks to maximize muscle growth and prevent plateaus.131 For body recomposition, calorie and training intensity cycling can be beneficial.71 7. Program Design Patterns The way workout days are structured throughout the week can significantly impact training effectiveness and adherence. Several evidence-based program design patterns have proven popular and effective for various fitness goals.55 Full body workout splits involve training all major muscle groups in each session and are often recommended for beginners due to their simplicity and efficiency, typically performed 2-3 days per week.133 Upper/lower splits divide the body into upper and lower body workouts, allowing for more focused training and volume per muscle group, usually performed 4 days per week.135 Push/pull/legs (PPL) splits categorize exercises based on movement patterns, with one day dedicated to pushing movements (chest, shoulders, triceps), another to pulling movements (back, biceps), and a third to legs; this split is often done 3 or 6 days per week and is popular among intermediate lifters.133 Body part splits, where each workout focuses on one or two specific muscle groups, are more common among advanced bodybuilders and are typically performed 5-6 days per week to allow for high training volume per muscle group.55 The decision of when to use low-volume/high-intensity programs versus high-volume/moderate-intensity programs depends largely on the primary training goal.6 High-volume, moderate-intensity training is generally considered optimal for muscle hypertrophy, while low-volume, high-intensity programs can be effective for strength development and may be more suitable for individuals with limited time.137 Structuring workout days over the week should align with the chosen split type, training frequency, and the user's recovery capacity.55 For example, a 3-day full body routine might be scheduled with rest days in between (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday), while a 4-day upper/lower split could be done Monday/Tuesday and Thursday/Friday.55 A 6-day PPL split often follows a Monday-Saturday schedule with Sunday as a rest day.139 Traditional workout splits, such as body part splits, allow for a high volume of training to be focused on individual muscle groups, which can be advantageous for hypertrophy.134 However, they require a greater time commitment and may not be as efficient for beginners or those with limited time.140 Full body routines, on the other hand, are time-efficient and ensure all major muscle groups are trained in each session, making them ideal for beginners and those with busy schedules.141 However, advanced lifters\n---\nbeginners to lift heavier weights and stimulate overall muscle growth more effectively. The structure of this Push day incorporates a mix of barbell, dumbbell, and bodyweight exercises, providing a well-rounded approach for beginners to develop foundational strength and learn different movement patterns.1 Barbell and dumbbell exercises often require more core engagement and coordination, while bodyweight exercises like tricep dips can help build functional strength. The Pull Day consists of Pull Ups (or Lat Pull Downs) (5 sets of 5 repetitions), Bent-Over Barbell Row (3 sets of 5 repetitions), T-Bar Row (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Dumbbell Shrug (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Preacher Curl (3 sets of 8 repetitions), and Hammer Curl (3 sets of 8 repetitions), with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Similar to the Push day, the focus is on strength development with the compound pulling exercises (Pull Ups/Lat Pull Downs, Bent-Over Barbell Row) utilizing lower rep ranges. This Pull day effectively targets both vertical (Pull-ups/Lat Pulldowns) and horizontal (Bent-Over Barbell Row, T-Bar Row) pulling movements, ensuring comprehensive back muscle development.5 Vertical pulls primarily target the latissimus dorsi and contribute to back width, while horizontal pulls target the mid-back muscles, contributing to back thickness. The Leg Day includes Barbell Squat (5 sets of 5 repetitions), Deadlift (3 sets of 5 repetitions), Leg Press (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Lying Leg Curl (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Leg Extension (3 sets of 8 repetitions), and Seated Calf Raise (3 sets of 8 repetitions), with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. The Barbell Squat and Deadlift, both performed for 5 repetitions, are excellent compound exercises for building lower body strength.1 The Leg day incorporates both knee-dominant exercises (Squat, Leg Press, Leg Extension) and hip-dominant exercises (Deadlift, Lying Leg Curl), ensuring balanced development of the major lower body muscle groups.5 Knee-dominant exercises primarily target the quadriceps, while hip-dominant exercises focus on the hamstrings and glutes.
