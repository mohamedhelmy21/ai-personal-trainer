Hydration and Electrolyte Intake for Training\nMaintaining proper hydration is as critical to athletic performance as nutrition.12 Even mild dehydration can significantly impair performance, affecting everything from endurance and strength to cognitive function.10 For every hour of physical activity, individuals can lose a substantial amount of fluid, along with essential electrolytes like sodium.11 Adequate hydration is crucial for regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and removing metabolic waste products.4 It also plays a vital role in lubricating joints, influencing flexibility and speed, and is essential for proper muscle function, including the heart.11 Dehydration can even affect breathing by reducing the ability to moisten inhaled air, and it can negatively impact mood, concentration, and lead to headaches and irritability.11 A decrease in body weight of just 2% or more due to dehydration can have a detrimental effect on athletic performance.10\nTo ensure adequate hydration, athletes should begin their exercise sessions in a well-hydrated state.10 It is recommended to drink 16 to 24 fluid ounces of water within the two hours leading up to training, and an additional 7 to 10 fluid ounces about 10 to 20 minutes prior to starting.10 During exercise, athletes should aim to consume approximately 6 to 12 fluid ounces of fluid every 10 to 20 minutes throughout their training, and it is important to drink even if not feeling thirsty.10 Following exercise, it is recommended to record body weight before and after training to assess fluid losses, especially in hot and humid conditions or during intense training.10 For every pound of weight lost, athletes should consume 16 to 24 fluid ounces of water within the first two hours post-training, with full rehydration occurring within six hours.10 General guidelines suggest that adults should consume 6 to 12 ounces of fluid for every 20 minutes of sports play, teenagers (ages 13 to 18) should consume 11 to 16 ounces, and children (ages 9 to 12) should consume 3 to 8 ounces for the same duration.11\nElectrolytes, particularly sodium, potassium, and chloride, are lost through sweat.10 Sodium is the primary electrolyte lost and is essential for helping cells retain fluids.10 Athletes engaged in training or competition lasting longer than two hours, or those who experience high sweat rates, should focus on replacing both fluids and sodium during exercise.8 Insufficient sodium intake can lead to muscle cramps and hinder performance.10 Sports drinks can be beneficial for replacing electrolytes, especially during prolonged activity.5 Isotonic sports drinks, which have a carbohydrate and electrolyte balance similar to that of human blood, are often recommended for restoring electrolyte balance after activities that involve significant sweating.11 It is important to choose a drink based on individual sweat and salt losses.11 While water is essential for hydration, it does not contain electrolytes, so for longer duration activities, a sports drink or a small salty snack before exercise might be beneficial for fluid retention.8 After exercise, sodium and other electrolytes can typically be replenished through a balanced diet.8 It is generally advisable to avoid beverages with a carbohydrate concentration higher than 8% during training, as these can slow down fluid absorption 10, and energy drinks are not recommended during exercise.8"
