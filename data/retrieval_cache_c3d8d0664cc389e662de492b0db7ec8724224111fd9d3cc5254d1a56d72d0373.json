"**Workout A** includes Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 10 reps), Barbell Squat (3 sets of 10 reps), Pull-Up (3 sets of 8 reps), Machine Leg Curl (Prone) (3 sets of 8 reps), Dumbbell Shoulder Press (2 sets of 10 reps), Cable Rope Face Pull (2 sets of 15 reps), Barbell Drag Curl (2 sets of 8 reps), and Machine Calf Raise (2 sets of 15 reps). The rest periods are 3 minutes for the compound exercises (Barbell Bench Press, Barbell Squat, Pull-Up) and 1.5-2 minutes for the isolation exercises. The moderate rep ranges (8-15) and longer rest periods for compound exercises are typical for hypertrophy-focused training.\n---\nThe **Pull Workout** consists of Pull-Ups OR Kneeling Lat Pulldowns (3-4 sets of 6-10 or 10-15 repetitions), Barbell Row (3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions), Reverse Grip Lat Pulldowns (3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions), Chest Supported Rear Delt Row (3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions), Close Grip Barbell Curl (2-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions), and Face Pulls (Kneeling + Lying) (2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions). This workout targets all the upper body pulling muscles (back and biceps), along with the rear deltoids. The routine strategically alternates between vertical and horizontal pulling movements to ensure comprehensive back development. The exercise selection is justified based on their ability to activate specific back muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi and trapezius.[5]\n---\n**Workout 2** introduces variety and targets the mid and lower chest, hamstrings, upper and outer back, glutes, side deltoids, and abs, featuring Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 4-6 reps), Romanian Deadlift (3 sets of 6-8 reps), Lat Pulldown (3 sets of 8-12 reps), Glute-Focused Walking Lunges (3 sets of 6-10 reps per leg), and a superset of Behind The Body Cable Lateral Raises and Reverse Crunches (3 sets of 10-15 reps).\n---\nform, progressive overload, adequate rest and recovery, and consistency are crucial for achieving desired results. These templates serve as excellent starting points that can be further adjusted based on individual needs and preferences. VII.
