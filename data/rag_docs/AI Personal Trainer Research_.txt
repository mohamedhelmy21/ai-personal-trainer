Evidence-Based Training Principles for AI Personal Trainer Systems
1. Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence into personalized fitness training systems presents an evolving landscape with the potential to revolutionize how individuals approach their health and wellness goals. These AI-driven platforms aim to provide tailored workout and nutrition plans, adapting to user progress and preferences in a manner previously accessible only through human personal trainers. At the core of any successful AI personal trainer lies the necessity for its recommendations to be rooted in established, science-backed training rules and principles. This ensures that the generated plans are not only effective in achieving the user's objectives but also safe and sustainable for long-term adherence. This report serves as a comprehensive compilation of up-to-date, evidence-based training principles spanning multiple domains within exercise science. Its purpose is to provide a robust foundation of knowledge that can guide the design and functionality of an AI personal trainer, ensuring it leverages the most current and reliable practices in the field, moving beyond anecdotal evidence and outdated methodologies.
2. User Profiling and Segmentation
Effective personalization in an AI fitness system hinges on the ability to accurately categorize and understand its users. This segmentation allows for the delivery of tailored plans that address individual needs, preferences, and limitations.1 Several key factors should be considered when profiling users for a fitness training system.
2.1. Fitness Goals
A primary method of user segmentation involves identifying the individual's overarching fitness goals.3 Common primary goals include fat loss, where the primary objective is to reduce body fat percentage; muscle building, focused on increasing lean body mass and muscular size; and general health, which typically encompasses improvements in cardiovascular fitness, strength, flexibility, and overall well-being.3 Recognizing these fundamental distinctions is crucial as each goal requires a unique combination of training modalities, nutritional strategies, and recovery protocols.5 For instance, a program designed for fat loss will likely emphasize a caloric deficit and incorporate a significant amount of cardiovascular exercise, while a muscle building program will necessitate a caloric surplus and a focus on resistance training with adequate protein intake.5 General health goals may be addressed through a balanced program that includes both aerobic and anaerobic exercises, along with attention to flexibility and mobility.5
2.2. Subgoals
Beyond the primary fitness goal, users often have more specific subgoals that provide a finer level of detail for program design.4 These subgoals can include developing muscular strength, increasing muscle size (hypertrophy), improving cardiovascular endurance, or achieving body recomposition – the simultaneous loss of fat and gain of muscle.6 Each of these subgoals requires specific manipulation of training variables. For example, strength training typically involves lifting heavy loads for low repetitions, whereas hypertrophy training focuses on moderate loads and repetitions with sufficient volume.6 Endurance training necessitates sustained activity or repeated high-intensity intervals.8 Body recomposition demands a nuanced approach that balances the stimuli for muscle growth and fat loss, often involving a combination of resistance training, strategic cardio, and careful nutritional planning.10
2.3. Experience Levels
Categorizing users by their experience level is essential for ensuring program safety and effectiveness.14 The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) provides a framework for defining experience levels based on training age, frequency, training stress, and technique proficiency (Table 1).14 Beginners, with less than two months of consistent training, typically require programs that emphasize proper exercise technique and foundational strength development, using lower training volumes and intensities.14 Intermediate users, having trained consistently for 2-6 months, can often handle more complex routines, increased training volumes, and a wider variety of exercises.14 Advanced individuals, with over six months of dedicated training, may benefit from highly specialized programs incorporating advanced intensity techniques and periodization strategies.14
2.4. Activity Levels
A user's activity level outside of their planned workouts also plays a significant role in their overall fitness and recovery needs.20 This can be broadly classified using daily step counts or through Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) values, which indicate the intensity of various activities (Table 2).20 A sedentary individual, spending most of their day sitting, will have different energy expenditure and recovery requirements compared to a super active person engaged in intense physical labor or prolonged exercise.24 Understanding a user's baseline activity level helps the AI system to estimate their total daily energy expenditure more accurately and to tailor workout intensity and volume appropriately, ensuring that the program is challenging yet manageable.21
2.5. Equipment Access
The availability of fitness equipment is a practical constraint that directly influences exercise selection.31 An AI personal trainer must consider whether a user has access to a full gym, a home gym setup, or only minimal equipment such as resistance bands or their own body weight.33 The system should be capable of generating effective workout plans regardless of these limitations, offering suitable exercise alternatives based on the user's specific circumstances.31 For example, users with minimal equipment access might focus on bodyweight exercises and resistance band variations, while those with a gym membership can utilize a wider array of machines and free weights.36
2.6. Age Range
The primary target audience for the AI personal trainer is individuals aged 18-45, with potential later support for the 45-65 age group.37 Age is a significant factor influencing physiological responses to exercise, recovery rates, and individual preferences for training modalities.15 The AI should consider these age-related differences when designing workout plans, potentially recommending lower impact exercises or longer warm-up and cool-down periods for older users.37
2.7. Gender Differences
Accounting for gender-based physiological differences and common fitness goals is important for personalization.15 These include variations in upper and lower body strength, common goals such as glute development for many female users, and potential differences in flexibility and mobility.39 The AI should allow for customization based on gender, acknowledging these common trends without making broad generalizations or delving into clinical-level hormonal considerations.39
2.8. Preexisting Conditions
For the initial version of the AI system, users with significant injuries, chronic illnesses, or rehabilitation needs will be excluded.44 The AI should include a clear disclaimer advising users with such conditions to seek guidance from a healthcare professional before using the system.
2.9. Natural Training Only
The AI system is designed to cater to natural lifters only.10 Therefore, all recommendations regarding recovery, progressive overload, and training intensity should align with natural physiological responses. The system should not provide advice related to performance-enhancing drugs or supplement-heavy protocols.10
3. Training Principles by Goal & Subgoal
The foundation of effective workout programming lies in adhering to established training principles that are tailored to specific fitness goals and subgoals. These principles dictate the key variables of a training program, such as frequency, intensity, volume, and exercise selection.
3.1. General Fitness
For individuals aiming for general fitness, a balanced approach that incorporates both cardiovascular and resistance training is recommended.45 Guidelines from the ACSM and NSCA suggest engaging in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes on five days per week, or vigorous-intensity activity for at least 20 minutes on three days per week.45 Additionally, strength training targeting all major muscle groups should be performed a minimum of two days per week.45 For resistance training, a repetition range of 8-15 for 1-3 sets is often appropriate for general fitness, with rest periods between sets lasting 30-90 seconds.46 Workout splits such as full body routines or upper/lower and push/pull splits can be effective.46 Prioritizing compound exercises like squats, lunges, and presses ensures efficient training of multiple muscle groups.51
3.2. Strength
Training for strength requires a focus on lifting heavier loads to elicit neuromuscular adaptations.7 The NSCA recommends a weekly training frequency of 3-4 days for beginner and intermediate individuals, increasing to 4-7 days for advanced lifters.14 Repetitions are typically kept low, generally 6 or fewer per set, with 2-6 sets per exercise.48 Rest periods between sets should be longer, ranging from 2-5 minutes, to allow for sufficient recovery to maintain high intensity.49 The intensity should be high, typically above 85% of the user's one-repetition maximum (1RM).48 Priority should be given to compound exercises that engage multiple large muscle groups, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, and rows.53 Workout split options include upper/lower splits or push/pull splits, which allow for adequate recovery between sessions targeting the same muscle groups.50
3.3. Endurance
Endurance training involves improving the body's ability to sustain prolonged physical activity.56 Weekly training frequency is often higher, around 4-6 times per week.58 For muscular endurance, resistance training involves higher repetitions (greater than 12) and fewer sets (2-3), with lighter loads (less than 67% 1RM) and shorter rest periods (30 seconds or less).48 Cardiovascular training plays a crucial role, with recommendations including both Low-Intensity Steady State (LISS) cardio and High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).59 LISS typically involves maintaining a heart rate between 50-70% of maximum for 30-60 minutes, while HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by recovery periods.61 While compound exercises are still important, endurance training may also incorporate more sport-specific movements.63 Full body or upper/lower splits can be used to structure the weekly workouts.55
3.4. Hypertrophy
Training for muscle growth, or hypertrophy, requires a balance of mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage.6 A weekly training frequency of 2-3 times per muscle group is generally recommended.58 Repetitions typically fall in the range of 6-12 per set, with 3-6 sets per exercise.65 The intensity is usually moderate to high, between 67-85% of 1RM, and rest periods between sets range from 30-90 seconds.65 Effective hypertrophy programs incorporate both compound exercises to stimulate overall muscle growth and isolation exercises to target specific muscle groups.51 Common workout splits include body part splits, upper/lower splits, and push/pull/legs splits, allowing for sufficient volume and recovery for each muscle group.68
3.5. Recomposition
Body recomposition, aiming to simultaneously lose fat and gain muscle, requires a multifaceted approach.70 A training frequency of 3-5 days per week is common.70 Repetition ranges often fall in the 8-12 range, with moderate to high intensity and rest periods around 1 minute.70 Prioritizing compound lifts is crucial for muscle preservation and growth, and incorporating HIIT cardio helps to increase calorie expenditure and fat loss.70 Workout splits can vary, including full body or split routines.70 A key element of recomposition is managing caloric intake to create a slight deficit while ensuring adequate protein intake to support muscle growth.72
4. Cardio Programming
Cardiovascular exercise plays a vital role in overall fitness and can be strategically incorporated into training programs to complement specific goals and subgoals. The choice between Low-Intensity Steady State (LISS) and High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) depends on the desired outcomes.60
LISS cardio, typically performed at 50-70% of maximum heart rate for a sustained duration (30-60 minutes), is beneficial for improving cardiovascular endurance, enhancing fat burning during the activity, and facilitating recovery.61 It primarily utilizes the aerobic energy system, relying on fat as the primary fuel source.73 HIIT, on the other hand, involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise (80-95% of maximum heart rate) interspersed with recovery periods.60 HIIT is more time-efficient for burning calories, improves cardiovascular fitness and performance, and may help preserve lean muscle mass during periods of caloric restriction.62 It engages both anaerobic (phosphagen and glycolytic) and aerobic energy systems.74
General guidelines recommend at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.77 For LISS, this might translate to 3-5 sessions per week, each lasting 30-60 minutes. HIIT can be performed 1-3 times per week for 10-30 minutes per session.77
The potential interference of cardio with strength and hypertrophy training is a consideration.79 While the extent of this effect is debated, it can be minimized by performing cardio after resistance training, prioritizing HIIT over prolonged LISS, choosing low-impact cardio options, and allowing adequate recovery time between sessions (ideally on separate days or with a gap of at least 6 hours).79 When both cardio and strength training must be done on the same day, strength training should generally be performed first to avoid fatigue-related reductions in lifting performance.80
Understanding the energy systems targeted by different cardio modalities is crucial for aligning training with specific goals.73 For endurance, LISS training that primarily uses the aerobic system is beneficial. For improving power and speed, HIIT that engages the anaerobic systems is more appropriate. Fat loss can be achieved through both LISS and HIIT, although HIIT's higher calorie burn in a shorter time frame and the post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) effect may offer advantages.62
5. Recovery & Rest
Adequate recovery and rest are integral components of any effective training program, allowing the body to repair, adapt, and prevent overtraining.83
The frequency of rest days should be tailored to the user's training goals, intensity, and experience level.85 For general fitness, 1-3 rest days per week are typically recommended.85 Strength training often necessitates at least 48 hours of rest between sessions targeting the same muscle groups.87 Endurance athletes may train more frequently but still require recovery periods.89 Hypertrophy programs usually benefit from 2-3 rest days per week to allow for muscle protein synthesis.58 Body recomposition routines often incorporate 1-2 rest days to balance training and recovery.70
Active recovery, involving low-intensity activities like walking, light jogging, swimming, cycling, yoga, or foam rolling, can enhance the recovery process by increasing blood flow to muscles, reducing soreness, and facilitating the removal of metabolic waste products without placing additional stress on the body.91 Active recovery sessions typically last around 20-30 minutes and can be performed on rest days or after intense workouts.93
The optimal use of stretching versus mobility routines depends on the timing relative to training.95 Dynamic stretching and mobility exercises, such as leg swings and arm circles, are generally recommended before workouts to warm up muscles and improve range of motion.95 Static stretching, involving holding stretches for 10-30 seconds, is more beneficial after training when muscles are warm to improve flexibility and aid in recovery.97
Deloading, a planned reduction in training intensity or volume, is a strategic recovery tool that can be implemented every 4-12 weeks to allow the body to recover, reduce fatigue, prevent overtraining, and potentially help users break through plateaus.99 During a deload week, users might reduce their lifting weight, repetitions, sets, or training frequency by 40-50%.101
Incorporating breathwork and stress reduction techniques can also aid in recovery.103 Focused breathing exercises like nasal breathing, box breathing, and the 4-7-8 method can help down-regulate the nervous system, reduce stress hormones such as cortisol, improve blood flow, and enhance sleep quality.103 Mindfulness meditation and yoga are other practices that can promote relaxation and improve recovery.106
6. Progression & Adaptation
The principle of progressive overload is fundamental to achieving long-term fitness improvements, regardless of the specific goal.108 It involves gradually increasing the demands placed on the body over time, forcing it to adapt and become stronger or more enduring.110 This can be accomplished by incrementally increasing the weight lifted, the number of repetitions or sets, the training frequency, the intensity of the exercise, the time under tension, or the difficulty of the exercise.108 For beginners, progress often occurs rapidly, while intermediate and advanced lifters may require more nuanced strategies and smaller increments of progression.113 A general guideline is to increase training load by no more than 10% per week, always prioritizing proper form over lifting heavier weight.108
Training plateaus, where progress stalls despite consistent effort, are a common experience.115 They can be detected by a lack of improvement in strength, endurance, or muscle growth, a decrease in motivation, persistent fatigue, or a lack of visible changes in body composition.117 To overcome plateaus, it's essential to identify the underlying cause, which might include a lack of variety in the training program, insufficient training stimulus, inadequate recovery, or issues with nutrition and sleep.115 Strategies for adapting training after hitting a plateau include introducing new exercises, modifying training variables such as sets, reps, intensity, tempo, and rest periods, incorporating different training styles like HIIT or circuit training, reviewing and adjusting nutritional intake and recovery protocols, and considering the implementation of deload weeks.117
Intensity techniques can be strategically employed to push past plateaus and provide a novel stimulus for muscle growth and strength gains.121 These techniques include drop sets, where the weight is reduced during a set after reaching failure to continue with more repetitions; rest-pause training, involving short rest intervals within a set to allow for more repetitions at a given weight; tempo manipulation, varying the speed of the concentric and eccentric phases of a lift; supersets, performing two exercises back-to-back; and pyramid sets, where weight is progressively increased or decreased across sets with corresponding changes in repetitions.123 These techniques are generally more suitable for intermediate to advanced lifters.125
Volume cycling and periodization are essential for long-term progress, particularly for hypertrophy and strength goals.126 Periodization involves planned cycles of training variables (volume, intensity) to optimize adaptation and manage fatigue.128 Linear periodization involves a gradual increase in intensity and decrease in volume over time, while undulating periodization incorporates more frequent variations in these variables.129 Volume cycling involves strategically varying the total amount of work performed over different training blocks to maximize muscle growth and prevent plateaus.131 For body recomposition, calorie and training intensity cycling can be beneficial.71
7. Program Design Patterns
The way workout days are structured throughout the week can significantly impact training effectiveness and adherence. Several evidence-based program design patterns have proven popular and effective for various fitness goals.55
Full body workout splits involve training all major muscle groups in each session and are often recommended for beginners due to their simplicity and efficiency, typically performed 2-3 days per week.133 Upper/lower splits divide the body into upper and lower body workouts, allowing for more focused training and volume per muscle group, usually performed 4 days per week.135 Push/pull/legs (PPL) splits categorize exercises based on movement patterns, with one day dedicated to pushing movements (chest, shoulders, triceps), another to pulling movements (back, biceps), and a third to legs; this split is often done 3 or 6 days per week and is popular among intermediate lifters.133 Body part splits, where each workout focuses on one or two specific muscle groups, are more common among advanced bodybuilders and are typically performed 5-6 days per week to allow for high training volume per muscle group.55
The decision of when to use low-volume/high-intensity programs versus high-volume/moderate-intensity programs depends largely on the primary training goal.6 High-volume, moderate-intensity training is generally considered optimal for muscle hypertrophy, while low-volume, high-intensity programs can be effective for strength development and may be more suitable for individuals with limited time.137
Structuring workout days over the week should align with the chosen split type, training frequency, and the user's recovery capacity.55 For example, a 3-day full body routine might be scheduled with rest days in between (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday), while a 4-day upper/lower split could be done Monday/Tuesday and Thursday/Friday.55 A 6-day PPL split often follows a Monday-Saturday schedule with Sunday as a rest day.139
Traditional workout splits, such as body part splits, allow for a high volume of training to be focused on individual muscle groups, which can be advantageous for hypertrophy.134 However, they require a greater time commitment and may not be as efficient for beginners or those with limited time.140 Full body routines, on the other hand, are time-efficient and ensure all major muscle groups are trained in each session, making them ideal for beginners and those with busy schedules.141 However, advanced lifters may find that full body workouts do not provide sufficient volume for specific muscle groups.143
8. Exercise Selection & Categorization
Choosing the right exercises is critical for achieving specific fitness goals and ensuring a well-rounded training program. Exercises can be broadly categorized into compound and isolation movements.51
Priority compound lifts are multi-joint exercises that engage several muscle groups simultaneously, making them highly efficient for building overall strength and muscle mass.51 For the chest, priority compound lifts include the bench press, incline press, dips, and push-ups.146 For the back, pull-ups, rows (barbell, dumbbell, cable), and deadlifts are key.55 Legs are effectively trained with squats (back, front, goblet), deadlifts, lunges, and leg presses.146 The overhead press is a primary compound exercise for the shoulders.146 For the arms, close-grip bench presses and dips target the triceps, while rows and pull-ups heavily involve the biceps.146
Isolation exercises are single-joint movements that focus on a specific muscle group.51 They are useful for targeting individual muscles, addressing imbalances, and enhancing muscle definition.51 Examples include bicep curls for the biceps, tricep extensions for the triceps, lateral raises for the shoulders, leg extensions and hamstring curls for the legs, and chest flyes for the chest.19
Warm-up routines should consist of 5-10 minutes of light cardiovascular activity followed by dynamic stretching that mimics the movements of the workout.153 Muscle activation exercises can also be included to prime specific muscle groups.153 Cool-down routines should last 5-10 minutes and involve a gradual decrease in the intensity of the workout followed by static stretching, holding each stretch for 10-30 seconds to target the muscles used during the session.153
Core training frameworks should incorporate exercises that target stability and strength in all planes of motion.156 This includes anti-rotation exercises like the Pallof press and single-arm carries, anti-extension exercises such as the plank and dead bug, and dynamic core exercises like wood chops and Russian twists.158 McGill's Big Three (curl-up, side bridge, bird dog) are also foundational exercises for core stability.162
9. Mobility & Stretching
Incorporating mobility and stretching routines is crucial for maintaining joint health, improving range of motion, preventing injuries, and enhancing recovery.96
For recovery days, static stretching routines that target major muscle groups such as hamstrings, shoulders, hips, and back are recommended. Holding each stretch for 30-60 seconds can help reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility.98 Yoga and foam rolling can also be valuable additions to a recovery routine.91
Warm-ups should prioritize dynamic stretching to prepare the body for exercise.165 Examples include leg swings, arm circles, torso twists, walking lunges, and high knees, which help to increase blood flow and improve joint mobility.166
Post-lifting cooldowns should include static stretching of the muscles that were worked during the session. Holding each stretch for 10-30 seconds can aid in muscle recovery and improve flexibility.98
Dynamic stretching involves active movements that take joints and muscles through a full range of motion, while static stretching involves holding a stretch in a stationary position.165 Dynamic stretching is generally better for warm-ups as it prepares the body for movement, whereas static stretching is more effective for improving flexibility and is typically done after exercise.96
Muscle group-specific stretching protocols are beneficial for targeting areas that tend to get tight. For hamstrings, exercises like lying hamstring stretches and Romanian deadlifts can be effective. For shoulders, arm circles and chest stretches are helpful. For hips, butterfly stretches and hip flexor stretches can improve mobility.166
10. Emerging & Alternative Models
The field of exercise science is continuously evolving, with emerging and alternative training models offering unique approaches to fitness. Low-volume, high-intensity training (HIT) involves short, intense workouts, often with just one set per exercise performed close to failure.169 Research suggests that HIT can be an effective and time-efficient method for building strength and muscle, particularly for individuals with limited time.169 Minimalist training approaches, involving as little as 1-2 workouts per week, have also shown to be surprisingly effective for maintaining and even building strength and muscle, highlighting that lack of time need not be a barrier to training.169 Eccentric-overload training focuses on emphasizing the muscle-lengthening (eccentric) phase of an exercise, typically performed slowly over 3-10 seconds.65 This method can lead to increased muscle damage and promote hypertrophy. Recent research indicates that training close to failure (within 1-2 repetitions) can yield similar muscle growth and strength gains compared to consistently training to complete failure, potentially with less fatigue.169 These emerging and alternative models offer efficient and effective training strategies that can be particularly appealing to busy users or those seeking to optimize their workouts with novel techniques.

12. Key Principles and If-Then Logic Rules
Based on the comprehensive review of research and guidelines, the following key principles and "if-then" logic rules can be used to guide the development of the rule-based AI personal trainer engine:
* IF user goal is "fat loss" AND experience level is "beginner," THEN recommend a program with 3 full-body strength training sessions per week (3 sets of 10-12 reps, 60 seconds rest) and 3 LISS cardio sessions per week (30 minutes at 60-70% HRmax).
* IF user goal is "muscle building" AND experience level is "intermediate," THEN suggest an upper/lower split with 4 training days per week, 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, and 60-90 seconds rest, incorporating both compound and isolation exercises.
* IF user goal is "strength" AND experience level is "advanced," THEN recommend a push/pull/legs split with 6 training days per week, 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps, and 3-5 minutes rest, prioritizing compound lifts.
* IF user goal is "endurance" AND prefers HIIT, THEN suggest 2-3 HIIT sessions per week (20-30 minutes) alternating with 2-3 LISS sessions (45-60 minutes).
* IF user reports a training plateau in strength, THEN suggest implementing progressive overload by increasing the weight by 2.5-5% or adding 1-2 reps to each set.
* IF user reports a training plateau in hypertrophy, THEN suggest increasing training volume by adding one set per exercise or incorporating an intensity technique like drop sets on isolation exercises.
* IF user indicates only "home" and "minimal" equipment access, THEN prioritize bodyweight exercises and resistance band variations for all muscle groups.
* IF user indicates "gym" access, THEN include a variety of free weight and machine exercises in the program.
* IF user is in the age range of 45-65, THEN recommend a slightly longer warm-up (10-15 minutes) and cool-down (10 minutes), and consider lower impact exercise options.
* IF user indicates a goal of glute emphasis (common for female users), THEN incorporate exercises like hip thrusts, glute bridges, and Romanian deadlifts into their lower body routines.
* IF user has been following a high-intensity training program for 6-8 weeks, THEN suggest a deload week with a 50% reduction in training volume and intensity.
* IF user reports significant muscle soreness, THEN recommend an active recovery day with light activity and stretching.
* IF user is a beginner, THEN prioritize full body workout routines to build a foundational understanding of movement patterns and overall strength.
* IF user is an intermediate or advanced lifter aiming for hypertrophy, THEN consider implementing a push/pull/legs split or an upper/lower split to allow for increased training volume per muscle group.
* IF user's primary goal is strength, THEN prioritize compound exercises at the beginning of the workout.
* IF user's primary goal is hypertrophy, THEN include a mix of compound and isolation exercises, ensuring sufficient volume for each muscle group.
* IF user is an endurance athlete incorporating strength training, THEN recommend lower volume, higher intensity strength workouts to minimize interference with endurance performance.
* IF user is performing both cardio and strength training in the same session, THEN advise performing strength training before cardio.
* IF user is warming up for strength training, THEN recommend 5-10 minutes of light cardio followed by dynamic stretching targeting the muscles to be worked.
* IF user is cooling down after strength training, THEN recommend 5-10 minutes of light cardio followed by static stretching of the worked muscle groups.
* IF user is focusing on core training, THEN include a balance of anti-rotation, anti-extension, and dynamic core exercises.
These principles and rules provide a starting point for the AI trainer's logic, which can be further refined and expanded based on user feedback and ongoing research in exercise science.
