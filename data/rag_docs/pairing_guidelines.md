## üö´ Unrealistic or Odd Pairings (To Avoid)

### ‚ùå Oats with Savory/Fatty Ingredients
- **Avoid**: Oats + onion, oats + garlic, oats + cheese, oats + spinach, oats + olive oil
- **Reason**: Oats are typically eaten sweet. These combinations create conflicting taste and meal context.

### ‚ùå Cheese + Bread + Butter/Oil
- **Avoid**: Gouda or Cheddar + White Bread + Butter/Olive Oil
- **Reason**: This becomes overly greasy and lacks vegetables or fiber to balance the fat load.

### ‚ùå Tuna with Breakfast Ingredients
- **Avoid**: Tuna + oats, tuna + banana
- **Reason**: Tuna is a savory lunch protein and clashes with breakfast components.

### ‚ùå Yogurt or Milk with Saut√©ed Vegetables
- **Avoid**: Yogurt/Milk + onion, garlic, spinach
- **Reason**: These dairy items are typically used in sweet or cold dishes, not with stir-fried vegetables.
