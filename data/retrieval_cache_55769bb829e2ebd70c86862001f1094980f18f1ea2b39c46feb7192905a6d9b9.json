The structure of this Push day incorporates a mix of barbell, dumbbell, and bodyweight exercises, providing a well-rounded approach for beginners to develop foundational strength and learn different movement patterns.1 Barbell and dumbbell exercises often require more core engagement and coordination, while bodyweight exercises like tricep dips can help build functional strength. The Pull Day consists of Pull Ups (or Lat Pull Downs) (5 sets of 5 repetitions), Bent-Over Barbell Row (3 sets of 5 repetitions), T-Bar Row (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Dumbbell Shrug (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Preacher Curl (3 sets of 8 repetitions), and Hammer Curl (3 sets of 8 repetitions), with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Similar to the Push day, the focus is on strength development with the compound pulling exercises (Pull Ups/Lat Pull Downs, Bent-Over Barbell Row) utilizing lower rep ranges. This Pull day effectively targets both vertical (Pull-ups/Lat Pulldowns) and horizontal (Bent-Over Barbell Row, T-Bar Row) pulling movements, ensuring comprehensive back muscle development.5 Vertical pulls primarily target the latissimus dorsi and contribute to back width, while horizontal pulls target the mid-back muscles, contributing to back thickness. The Leg Day includes Barbell Squat (5 sets of 5 repetitions), Deadlift (3 sets of 5 repetitions), Leg Press (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Lying Leg Curl (3 sets of 8 repetitions), Leg Extension (3 sets of 8 repetitions), and Seated Calf Raise (3 sets of 8 repetitions), with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. The Barbell Squat and Deadlift, both performed for 5 repetitions, are excellent compound exercises for building lower body strength.1 The Leg day incorporates both knee-dominant exercises (Squat, Leg Press, Leg Extension) and hip-dominant exercises (Deadlift, Lying Leg Curl), ensuring balanced development of the major lower body muscle groups.5 Knee-dominant exercises primarily target the quadriceps, while hip-dominant exercises focus on the hamstrings and glutes.

The rest periods are 3 minutes for the compound exercises (Barbell Bench Press, Barbell Squat, Pull-Up) and 1.5-2 minutes for the isolation exercises. The moderate rep ranges (8-15) and longer rest periods for compound exercises are typical for hypertrophy-focused training."
