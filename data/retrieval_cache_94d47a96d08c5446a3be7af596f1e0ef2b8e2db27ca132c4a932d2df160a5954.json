"The **Push Workout** includes Incline Barbell Bench Press (3-4 sets of 6-8 repetitions), Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Press (3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions), Paused Flat Dumbbell Press (3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions), Lean-Away Dumbbell Lateral Raise (2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions), Seated Decline Cable Flies W/ Supination (2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions), and Incline Dumbbell Overhead Extensions (2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions). This workout targets all the upper body pushing muscles (chest, shoulders, and triceps) with a mix of compound and isolation exercises. The varied rep ranges (6-15) aim to stimulate both strength and hypertrophy. The rationale behind the exercise selection is provided, often referencing EMG analysis to support the effectiveness of each movement for targeting specific muscle fibers.[5] For example, the paused flat dumbbell press is included to help build strength out of the weakest position by eliminating the stretch-shortening reflex.\n---\n**Workout A** includes Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 10 reps), Barbell Squat (3 sets of 10 reps), Pull-Up (3 sets of 8 reps), Machine Leg Curl (Prone) (3 sets of 8 reps), Dumbbell Shoulder Press (2 sets of 10 reps), Cable Rope Face Pull (2 sets of 15 reps), Barbell Drag Curl (2 sets of 8 reps), and Machine Calf Raise (2 sets of 15 reps). The rest periods are 3 minutes for the compound exercises (Barbell Bench Press, Barbell Squat, Pull-Up) and 1.5-2 minutes for the isolation exercises. The moderate rep ranges (8-15) and longer rest periods for compound exercises are typical for hypertrophy-focused training.\n---\nWorkout Day\n\tExercise\n\tSets\n\tReps\n\tFrequency\n\tPush\n\tFlat Barbell Bench Press\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\tPush\n\tStanding Overhead Press\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\tPush\n\tIncline Dumbbell Bench Press\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\tPush\n\tDumbbell Side Lateral Raise\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\tPull\n\tDeadlift\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\tPull\n\tPull-up\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\tPull\n\tOne-Arm Dumbbell Row\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\tPull\n\tDumbbell Curl\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\tLegs\n\tBack Squat\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\tLegs\n\tLeg Press\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\tLegs\n\tBulgarian Split Squat\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\tLegs\n\tSeated Calf Raise\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n---\nWorkout Day\n\tExercise\n\tSets\n\tReps\n\tFrequency\n\t1\n\tIncline Dumbbell Press\n\t3\n\t8-12\n\t1/week\n\t1\n\tBarbell Squats\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\t1\n\tDumbbell Chest Supported Row\n\t3\n\t8-12\n\t1/week\n\t1\n\tLeg Curls\n\t3\n\t10-15\n\t1/week\n\t1\n\tSuperset: Lying Incline DB Curls & DB Overhead Extensions\n\t3\n\t8-12\n\t1/week\n\t2\n\tBarbell Bench Press\n\t3\n\t4-6\n\t1/week\n\t2\n\tRomanian Deadlift\n\t3\n\t6-8\n\t1/week\n\t2\n\tLat Pulldown\n\t3\n\t8-12\n\t1/week\n\t2\n\tGlute-Focused Walking Lunges\n\t3\n\t6-10\n\t1/week\n\t2\n\tSuperset: Behind The Body Cable Lateral Raises & Reverse Crunches\n\t3\n\t10-15\n\t1/week\n\t3\n\tSeated Dumbbell Shoulder Press\n\t3\n\t8-12\n\t1/week\n\t3\n\tLat-Focused Dumbbell Row\n\t3\n\t8-12\n\t1/week\n\t3\n\tHip Thrust\n\t3\n\t10-15\n\t1/week\n\t3\n\tLeg Extensions\n\t3\n\t10-15\n\t1/week\n\t3\n\tSuperset: Standing Calf Raises & Reverse Cable Flyes\n\t3\n\t10-15\n\t1/week\n---\n**Workout 2** introduces variety and targets the mid and lower chest, hamstrings, upper and outer back, glutes, side deltoids, and abs, featuring Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 4-6 reps), Romanian Deadlift (3 sets of 6-8 reps), Lat Pulldown (3 sets of 8-12 reps), Glute-Focused Walking Lunges (3 sets of 6-10 reps per leg), and a superset of Behind The Body Cable Lateral Raises and Reverse Crunches (3 sets of 10-15 reps)."
